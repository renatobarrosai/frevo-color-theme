# Frevo Theme for Todoist (web/desktop custom colors)

Custom color mapping for Todoist using the Frevo palette. Colors are taken directly from `theme/frevo-theme.yaml` with no modifications.

## Files
- `frevo.txt` — Suggested color assignments for Todoist labels/projects

## Usage
1. Open Todoist (web or desktop) and go to project/label color settings.
2. Apply the hex values from `frevo.txt` to your preferred projects/labels.
3. For filters or priority highlights, reuse the accent and semantic colors.

## Notes
- Variant: dark
- Accent: blue
- Background avoids pure black to reduce OLED haloing.
- Todoist doesn't support full themes; this provides a consistent palette for labels/projects.
